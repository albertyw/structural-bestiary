## Description ##
The hash table data structure is a way of linking variables (keys) to other
variables (values).  Therefore, it is an implementation of an associative
array.  The major benefit of hash tables is that it has constant time insert,
lookup, and deletion, the three of which together beat most other data
structures.

Hash tables are heavily based upon the hash functions that are used to compute
their keys.  Hash functions are discussed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function
