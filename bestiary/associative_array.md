## Use Cases ##
Since associative arrays are usually implemented as a hash table, associative
arrays can be used in any use case a hash table would be used in.  Associative
arrays also have additional benefits over hash tables since they bring in the
benefits of arrays such as being iterable.

## Implementations ##
Associative arrays are typically stored as hash tables with extra space and
logic dedicated to properties such as iteration.  In special use cases,
associative arrays may be implemented using simpler data structures such as a
linked list or normal array.  These data structures may have restrictions on
size or type of key but are easier to implement.
