Structural Bestiary
===================

Structural Bestiary is a guide for data structures.  Although we aim to include
as many important data structures as possible, we assume that readers are
familiar with the basic data structures (i.e. lists, hashes, and graphs) that
the Bestiary will build upon.

Our goal for this is that we realized that there are few websites or textbooks
that have a good overall listing and analysis of data structures.  Many
algorithms textbooks such as [CLRS](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)
include information about data structures but few of them directly focus on
data structures.  We also know about [Purely Functional Data Structures]
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) which approaches data
structures from a functional perspective.  Since there are already algorithms
and and functional focused data structure guides, the Structural Bestiary
will focus on data structures from an imperative/object oriented background.
